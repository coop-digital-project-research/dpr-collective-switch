  - ['tottington','Tottington High School', "We're raising money to keep our 10 year-old school minibus on the road. The minibus is a vital piece of school equipment for school trips and sports matches - raising £1000 would really help us extend its life."]
  - ['hanover','Hanover Primary School', 'Our climbing frame is not safe to use which means we can’t let the children play on it. We’re trying to raise £500 for a completely new climbing frame which will help children’s confidence and fitness. If 20 families switch to a green energy company, we will reach our goal.']
