      <h2>Story</h2>
      <p>We’re raising money for our school library by asking families to switch to a fantastic, small energy company that provides cheap, clean power.</p>

      <p>When you switch, Swinton Fitzwilliam gets £25. If 50 families pledge, we’ll be able to buy 75 more books for the school library.</p>

      <p>If you've never switched before, green energy will be cheaper and you'll never have to switch again.</p>

      <h2>Going green &mdash; and saving money</h2>

      <%= image_tag "school-with-panel.jpg" %>

      <p>3 years ago we installed solar panels on the roof to power our school. These panels, along with our batteries, now save us £3,000 a year! They also mean Swinton Fitzwilliam now burns far less dirty fossil fuels.</p>

      <p>This green switch will reduce our carbon footprint, equivalent to taking around 9 cars off the road.</p>

      <p><strong>It's in our power, together we can stop burning fossil fuels.</strong></p>
