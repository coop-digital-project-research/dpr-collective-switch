      <p>We need <%= current_page.data.raising_money_for %>.</p>

      <p>We're not asking you for any money.</p>

      <p>Instead, we want you to switch to a green energy company.</p>

      <p><%= current_page.data.school_name %> has joined up with Power Pack - a company that helps people switch to green energy.</p>

      <p>Every time a family switches, Power Pack will give our school money for <%= current_page.data.each_pledge_value %>.</p>

      <p>And if you get your energy from one of the 'big six' companies, and you've not switched recently, you'll see your bills go down.</p>

      <p>When <%= current_page.data.pledges_needed %> families switch, we get <%= current_page.data.specific_pledge_need %>.</p>
