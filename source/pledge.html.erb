  <h2>What we do with the information you give us</h2>

  <p>You are asked for your name and telephone number and the name of your current energy company (if you know it). This is so someone from Power Pack can call you and arrange your switch to a green energy company.</p>

  <p>Your school will only pass these details on to Power Pack. Power Pack will keep them in a secure location and only share them with the green energy company you switch to.</p>
