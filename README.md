This repo contains an example school pledge page for schools to send to parents, to encourage them to pledge to switch to a green energy company in order to raise money for the school.

If you're interested in setting up a green energy switching campaign yourself, you can fork this repo and adapt the webpages with your own branding. 

Let us know how you get on! Email paul.furley@coopdigital.co.uk

In addition to the example pledging webpage, there are some other assets which may be helpful. 

The research_promo_assets folder contains:
- a service map of the switching service, with the insights we gained from user research
- an email or letter template you can send to a school business manager to promote your campaign
- an email or letter template you can send to a school so they can send it to families to ask them to pledge
