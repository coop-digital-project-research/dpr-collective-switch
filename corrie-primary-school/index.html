      <h2>Story</h2>
      <p>We’re raising money for new playground equipment by asking families to switch to a fantastic, small energy company that provides cheap, clean power.</p>

      <p>When you switch, Corrie Primary School gets £25.</p>

      <p>If 50 families pledge, we’ll be able to buy new slide for the playground.</p>

      <p>If you've never switched before, green energy will be cheaper. It's a simple tariff that stays cheap year after year, unlike many of the big companies.</p>

      <h2>Going green &mdash; and saving money</h2>

      <img src="../images/corrie-primary-school/eco.jpg" alt="Eco" />

      <p>We already have a team of eco warriors who help the school to be greener by turning lights off when the classroom is empty, encouraging paper recycling and litter picking in the school grounds.</p>

      <p>This green switch will reduce our carbon footprint, equivalent to taking around 8 cars off the road.</p>

      <p><strong>It's in our power, together we can stop burning fossil fuels.</strong></p>
